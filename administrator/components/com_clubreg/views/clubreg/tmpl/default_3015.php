		<li>
			<p>Add a <b>Batch Update</b> function, which allows club officials to update multiple properties of more than one club member in a single operation.</p>
			<p>For example at the end of the year, if the club officials wanted to promote some club members from Under 7 to Unde 8 then the batch update function can be used. See site for demo</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Add a communication manager, which allows club officials to send communication {emails and sms} to club members.<br />
			<p>To use the sms function , you must signup to a bulk sms provider in your country, which supports the use of email to sms.<br />
			In most cases they would ask you to simply append a suffix to the the phone number.						
			</p>
			<p>So for example if you are in australia and you registered with a company called <a href="www.messagemedia.com.au" target="_blank">messagemedia.com.au</a>
				They would require that all sms to be sent have "@messagemedia.com.au" appended to them.
			</p>
			<p>Also the phone numbers have to be a valid phone number</p>
		</li>
		<li>Minor styling changes</li>
